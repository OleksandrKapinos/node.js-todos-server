# node.js-todos-server
Node.js Homework
Requirements:

● Create a simple server for “todo-checklist” application API using Node.js and
whatever DB you are comfortable with (MongoDB, MySQL)

● Todo items should consist of name and description (optional) fields

● Use Express as web framework

● Use either Mongoose or Sequelize to operate on Database

● API should provide ability to perform the following actions

○ addTodo - to add todo task (should not be possible to add todo with the
same name)

○ removeTodo - to remove todo item

○ getTodos - to get the list of todos from db

○ markDone - to mark todo item as completed

○ markUndone - to mark todo item as undone

● Request content should be validated within express middlewares

● Use joi module to validate request content

● All dependencies should be listed in package.json file.

● API resources named using REST naming convention (e.g. ‘GET /users’, ‘PUT
/users/:id’ instead of ‘GET /getUsersList’, ‘PUT /updateUserById/:id’ etc.)

● Server should handle application errors and return meaningful response with
appropriate HTTP status codes

● Will be a plus: API covered with tests, use Mocha or similar
